Homework No. 3 of the course "Fundamentals of programming in C++" from Top Academy. Teacher Zelik Alexander Maksimovich

Task 1. The user enters a number greater than zero from the keyboard, it is necessary to print all its digits, starting from the end.Note. For example, the user entered the number 12345. The number on the contrary should appear on the screen â€” 54321.

Task 2. The user enters a number from the keyboard, it is necessary to show the sum of its digits on the screen. Note. For example, the user entered the number 12345. A message should appear on the screen stating that the sum of the digits of the number is 15.

Task 3. On the first day, the snail crawled 15 cm. Every next day, she crawled 2 cm further. Determine the total distance the snail will crawl after N days.Note. For example, the user entered the number 4. Therefore, the snail crawled for 4 days, so the total path will be 72 cm.

Task 4. To make a decision, student D. tossed a coin 9 times. If, as a result, the number of coins dropped by the "eagle" side was an even number, he made a decision in the positive direction, otherwise in the negative. Write a program that requests the number 1 or 0 (heads/tails) 9 times and gives the corresponding result of solving the student's problem.

Task 5. Display the calendar for the selected month, taking into account the specified day of the week number for the beginning of the month. Hint. The program can be divided into two parts. The first cycle will output the required number of empty cells. The second cycle will start displaying the calendar from the first day to the last day in the specified month. The transition to a new line is considered a multiple of seven with the specified offset of the day of the week. Bonus task: determine the number of days off in a given month.
